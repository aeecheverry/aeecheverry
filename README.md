**Software Engineer & Founder of [Braincol](https://github.com/braincol)**

Building the security layer that AI agents need — starting with an open standard for secret protection.

### What I'm Building

I founded **Braincol** to solve a critical problem in the AI era: **agents that handle secrets shouldn't be able to leak them.**

| Project | What it is | License |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| [**Never-Leak Protocol**](https://github.com/braincol/never-leak-protocol) | Open standard defining 7 security levels for AI agent secret governance. Aligned with OWASP, RFC 7519, RFC 9180. | Apache 2.0 |
| [**Braincol Vault**](https://github.com/braincol/braincol-vault) | First production-ready NL Protocol implementation. Local-first secret manager where agents use secrets without ever seeing them. 2,445 tests, X25519 + ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption. | AGPLv3 |
| [**Braincol Sentry**](https://github.com/braincol/braincol-sentry) | Agentic data intelligence platform for financial monitoring. Source-agnostic, multi-tenant, policy-driven. | BSAL |

Braincol Vault integrates with **Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Windsurf, and Aider** — the agents developers actually use every day.

### Background

From a small town on Colombia's Caribbean coast. Got my first computer at 10 for being top student across local schools — that's when I fell in love with technology and never looked back.

Earned a scholarship, studied Systems Engineering at Universidad del Norte, and have spent 6+ years building scalable systems, leading engineering teams, and serving enterprise clients like **Oxxo, Transbank, and Enex** across Latin America.

Now channeling everything I've learned into Braincol — because the AI agent ecosystem deserves security infrastructure built with the same rigor as the agents themselves.
